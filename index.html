								I am Stephen Buskie. I was born and raised in Scotland and love that country with all my heart.
								I currently live in Houston Texas with my wife. Understandably, my lifestyle changed somewhat when compared to living in Scotland. My passions outside of work however remain unchanged; spending time in nature, mountain biking, creating videos of our travels and learning new things.
								<br /><br />
								I am an engineer by background and have been fortunate to enjoy a varied career for 9 years with my current employer. 
								I am seeking new opportunities as I have recently not been treated with the respect I expect from an employer.

								Working full time for a global corporation means my work is confidential. I have a couple of projects that are public.
								<br />
							
								<b>Deplpoyed solutions:</b>
								A friend of mine organised a daily walking challenge together with our friends. The goal was to encourage activity while our usual social activities continued to be reduced in 2021. The ensentive to walk was a raffle at the end of the year - each day we acheived 10,000 steps, we would recieve one raffle ticket. 
								My friend had two issues that I offered support with.
								<br />
								Firstly, googlesheets where we 'bought' our tickets was creating duplicate submissions and thus skewing the raffle ticket entries. Secondly, our friends were asking to see how they were getting on in realtime.
								<br />
								I utilised streamlit, an open source app framework for machine learning and data science projects, to solve these problems all in pure python. Check out the deployed dashboard here: <i><a href="https://share.streamlit.io/sbuskie/10k_challenge/main/10k_streamlit_dashboard_github.py" target="_blank">10k_challenge</a></i>
								<br />						
								<b>Web design:</b>
								Having zero HTML, CSS, or Java experience, I sought to showcase my ability to learn nessesary tools to fulfil my needs. In this case, I needed a website. 
								Using the great templates from the team at <a href="https://html5up.net">HTML5 UP</a> I set fourth building this simple yet effective site while also developing my skills. I hope you find it helpful.
